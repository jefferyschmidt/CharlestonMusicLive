# Architectural Analysis

The MusicLive architecture shows a solid foundation with clear separation of concerns between data collection, processing, and API access. The system follows a crawler-extractor pattern for data collection with a FastAPI-based REST API for data access. However, there are several areas for improvement:

1. **Crawler Management**: The current architecture lacks a robust crawler orchestration system. While there's a source configuration model, there's no clear scheduler or monitoring for crawl jobs.

2. **Error Handling**: The API has basic error handling, but the crawler/extractor components need more comprehensive error management, especially for handling network failures, parsing errors, and data inconsistencies.

3. **Data Deduplication**: There's no explicit mechanism for deduplicating events across different sources, which is critical for meeting the 95% coverage goal without duplicates.

4. **Observability**: While there's an admin status endpoint, the system lacks comprehensive logging, metrics collection, and alerting capabilities.

5. **Testing Infrastructure**: The project configuration includes pytest, but there's no clear testing strategy visible for the crawler components, which are critical for reliability.

6. **Dependency Management**: The project uses a mix of dependencies that should be rationalized, particularly around HTTP clients (httpx, aiohttp) and HTML parsing (selectolax, beautifulsoup4).

7. **Async Processing**: The API appears to use synchronous database connections, which could limit scalability under load.

# Design Patterns

Based on the existing codebase and requirements, I recommend the following design patterns and principles:

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Continue using the Extractor interface pattern for different venue parsers, allowing for easy addition of new venues.

2. **Repository Pattern**: Implement a clear data access layer to abstract database operations from business logic.

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Add circuit breakers for external API calls to prevent cascading failures when sources are unavailable.

4. **Event Sourcing**: Consider implementing event sourcing for tracking changes to event data over time, which would help with auditing and debugging.

5. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read and write operations, especially as the system scales.

6. **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection for services to improve testability and maintainability.

7. **Adapter Pattern**: Use adapters for external services like geocoding to make them easily replaceable.

8. **Observer Pattern**: Implement observers for monitoring crawler state changes and triggering alerts.

9. **Decorator Pattern**: Use decorators for cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, and rate limiting.

10. **Factory Pattern**: Implement factories for creating extractors based on source configuration.

# Implementation Guidance

Here are specific implementation recommendations:

1. **Crawler Orchestration**:
   ```python
   # Create a CrawlerScheduler class
   class CrawlerScheduler:
       def __init__(self, db_pool):
           self.db_pool = db_pool
           self.active_crawlers = {}
           
       async def schedule_crawls(self):
           """Schedule crawls based on source configurations."""
           async with self.db_pool.connection() as conn:
               sources = await conn.fetch(
                   """SELECT id, url, parser_type, politeness_delay_ms, 
                      last_crawl_at, crawl_frequency_hours
                      FROM source WHERE active = TRUE"""
               )
               
               for source in sources:
                   if self._should_crawl(source):
                       await self._start_crawl(source)
                       
       def _should_crawl(self, source):
           """Determine if a source should be crawled based on its schedule."""
           if source['last_crawl_at'] is None:
               return True
               
           next_crawl = source['last_crawl_at'] + \
                        timedelta(hours=source['crawl_frequency_hours'])
           return datetime.utcnow() >= next_crawl
   ```

2. **Extractor Factory**:
   ```python
   class ExtractorFactory:
       @staticmethod
       def create_extractor(parser_type, site_slug, source_url, tz_name="America/New_York"):
           """Create an appropriate extractor based on parser type."""
           if parser_type == "music_farm":
               return MusicFarmExtractor(site_slug, source_url, tz_name)
           elif parser_type == "pour_house":
               return PourHouseExtractor(site_slug, source_url, tz_name)
           # Add more extractors as needed
           else:
               raise ValueError(f"Unknown parser type: {parser_type}")
   ```

3. **Event Deduplication Service**:
   ```python
   class EventDeduplicationService:
       def __init__(self, db_pool):
           self.db_pool = db_pool
           
       async def deduplicate_events(self, extract_results, source_id):
           """Deduplicate events based on venue, artist, and time proximity."""
           # Group events by venue
           events_by_venue = {}
           for result in extract_results:
               venue_name = result.venue_name
               if venue_name not in events_by_venue:
                   events_by_venue[venue_name] = []
               events_by_venue[venue_name].append(result)
               
           # For each venue, find potential duplicates
           deduplicated = []
           for venue_events in events_by_venue.values():
               # Sort by start time
               venue_events.sort(key=lambda e: e.starts_at_utc)
               
               # Check for duplicates (events at same venue with similar times and artists)
               # Implementation details omitted for brevity
               
           return deduplicated
   ```

4. **Async Database Access**:
   ```python
   # Update API endpoints to use async database connections
   @app.get("/api/v1/venues/{venue_id}", response_model=VenueDetailResponse)
   async def get_venue_detail(venue_id: int):
       """Get detailed information about a specific venue."""
       try:
           async with get_db_pool().acquire() as conn:
               # Get venue details
               venue_row = await conn.fetchrow("""
                   SELECT v.id, v.name, v.address_line1, v.city, v.state, v.postal_code,
                          v.latitude, v.longitude, v.tz_name,
                          COUNT(e.id) as total_events
                   FROM venue v
                   LEFT JOIN event_instance e ON v.id = e.venue_id
                   WHERE v.id = $1
                   GROUP BY v.id, v.name, v.address_line1, v.city, v.state, v.postal_code,
                            v.latitude, v.longitude, v.tz_name
               """, venue_id)
               
               if not venue_row:
                   raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"Venue {venue_id} not found")
               
               # Rest of the implementation...
       except Exception as e:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Database error: {str(e)}")
   ```

5. **Structured Logging**:
   ```python
   import structlog

   logger = structlog.get_logger()

   class Crawler:
       def __init__(self, source_id, url, parser_type):
           self.source_id = source_id
           self.url = url
           self.parser_type = parser_type
           self.log = logger.bind(
               source_id=source_id,
               url=url,
               parser_type=parser_type
           )
           
       async def crawl(self):
           self.log.info("starting_crawl")
           try:
               # Crawling logic
               self.log.info("crawl_completed", event_count=len(events))
               return events
           except Exception as e:
               self.log.error("crawl_failed", error=str(e), exc_info=True)
               raise
   ```

# Scalability Considerations

To ensure MusicLive can scale effectively:

1. **Database Connection Pooling**:
   - Replace direct connections with a connection pool
   - Use async database drivers (asyncpg instead of psycopg)
   - Implement read replicas for high-traffic queries

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement cache invalidation when data changes
   - Cache geocoding results to reduce API calls

3. **Crawler Scaling**:
   - Implement a distributed crawler system using message queues
   - Use AWS SQS or RabbitMQ to distribute crawl jobs
   - Implement backoff strategies for rate limiting

4. **API Performance**:
   - Add pagination to all list endpoints
   - Implement query optimization for complex searches
   - Use database indexes strategically

5. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Implement Prometheus metrics for system health
   - Set up alerts for crawler failures and API errors
   - Add detailed logging for debugging

6. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Define infrastructure using Terraform or CloudFormation
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
   - Use containerization for consistent environments

7. **Load Testing**:
   - Implement load testing to identify bottlenecks
   - Set performance baselines and monitor for regressions
   - Test crawler performance under various conditions

# Code Review

Based on the provided code snippets, here are specific code review comments:

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Good use of FastAPI's typing system and response models
   - Consider adding more comprehensive validation for query parameters
   - The error handling is basic; add more specific error types and messages

2. **Database Connections**:
   - The `get_db_connection()` function creates a new connection for each request, which is inefficient
   - Replace with a connection pool pattern for better resource management
   - Consider using async database drivers for improved concurrency

3. **Extractor Interface**:
   - The `Extractor` interface is well-designed with a clear contract
   - Add validation for the extracted data to ensure consistency
   - Consider adding a method for handling pagination in source websites

4. **Project Configuration**:
   - There are redundant HTTP client libraries (httpx, aiohttp)
   - The dependency on both selectolax and beautifulsoup4 is unnecessary
   - The version constraints are appropriately specific

5. **Database Schema**:
   - The schema is well-structured with appropriate relationships
   - Add more indexes for common query patterns
   - Consider adding a full-text search index for event and venue searches

# Next Steps

Here are the recommended next steps for architectural improvements:

1. **Immediate Improvements**:
   - Implement a connection pool for database access
   - Add structured logging throughout the application
   - Create a crawler scheduler with proper error handling

2. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for extractors
   - Implement event deduplication logic
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Create monitoring dashboards for system health

3. **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Refactor database access to use async patterns
   - Implement a distributed crawler system
   - Add comprehensive metrics collection
   - Develop a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

4. **Long-term (1-3 months)**:
   - Implement a full observability stack (logging, metrics, tracing)
   - Add machine learning for improved event matching and deduplication
   - Develop a content enrichment pipeline for event data
   - Create a recommendation system for users based on event history

By following these recommendations, the MusicLive architecture will be more robust, scalable, and maintainable, better meeting the project's success metrics of 95% event coverage, 90% freshness, <2% error rate, and efficient crawling.
