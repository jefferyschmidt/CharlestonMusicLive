# Architectural Analysis

The MusicLive architecture demonstrates a solid foundation with clear separation of concerns between data collection, processing, and API access. The system follows a modular approach with well-defined interfaces for extractors and a comprehensive API layer. However, there are several areas for improvement:

1. **Crawler Infrastructure**: The current architecture has basic crawler capabilities but lacks robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and distributed crawling capabilities that would be necessary for scaling to many venues.

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: There's no clear pipeline for processing raw HTML into structured data, handling duplicates, or managing data quality issues.

3. **Monitoring and Observability**: The system lacks comprehensive logging, metrics collection, and alerting capabilities essential for maintaining high data quality.

4. **Testing Strategy**: There's no evident testing strategy for validating extractors against real-world HTML changes or regression testing.

5. **Configuration Management**: Source configurations appear to be stored in the database, but there's no clear mechanism for version control or deployment of configuration changes.

6. **Dependency Management**: The project uses a mix of Poetry and direct dependencies, which could lead to inconsistencies.

7. **Asynchronous Processing**: The API appears to be using FastAPI (which supports async), but the crawler infrastructure doesn't clearly leverage asynchronous processing for improved throughput.

8. **Data Validation**: There's limited validation of extracted data before it enters the system.

# Design Patterns

Based on the existing codebase and requirements, I recommend the following design patterns and principles:

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Continue using the Extractor interface pattern for different venue parsers, allowing for swappable parsing strategies.

2. **Repository Pattern**: Implement a clear data access layer to abstract database operations from business logic.

3. **Factory Pattern**: Create factories for instantiating appropriate extractors based on source configuration.

4. **Command Pattern**: Implement commands for crawler operations to encapsulate request processing logic.

5. **Observer Pattern**: Implement for monitoring crawl operations and triggering notifications on failures.

6. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement to prevent repeated failures when crawling problematic sources.

7. **Decorator Pattern**: Use for adding cross-cutting concerns like logging, metrics, and caching.

8. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility: Each class should have one reason to change
   - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
   - Interface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

9. **Dependency Injection**: Use for improved testability and loose coupling.

10. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Consider for decoupling crawling from processing and notification.

# Implementation Guidance

Here are specific implementation recommendations:

1. **Crawler Infrastructure**:
```python
# Create a robust crawler base class
class BaseCrawler:
    def __init__(self, source_config, http_client=None, logger=None):
        self.source_config = source_config
        self.http_client = http_client or httpx.AsyncClient()
        self.logger = logger or structlog.get_logger()
        self.retry_policy = RetryPolicy(
            max_retries=3, 
            backoff_factor=1.5,
            status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504]
        )
    
    async def fetch(self, url=None):
        """Fetch content with retry logic and politeness delays"""
        url = url or self.source_config.url
        retries = 0
        
        while retries <= self.retry_policy.max_retries:
            try:
                # Respect politeness settings
                await asyncio.sleep(self.source_config.politeness_delay_ms / 1000)
                
                self.logger.info("Fetching URL", url=url, attempt=retries+1)
                response = await self.http_client.get(
                    url, 
                    follow_redirects=True,
                    timeout=30.0
                )
                response.raise_for_status()
                return response.text
            except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
                if e.response.status_code in self.retry_policy.status_forcelist:
                    retries += 1
                    delay = self.retry_policy.backoff_factor * (2 ** retries)
                    self.logger.warning(
                        "Temporary error, retrying", 
                        url=url, 
                        status=e.response.status_code,
                        retry_after=delay
                    )
                    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
                else:
                    self.logger.error(
                        "HTTP error", 
                        url=url, 
                        status=e.response.status_code
                    )
                    raise
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error("Fetch error", url=url, error=str(e))
                raise
        
        raise Exception(f"Max retries exceeded for {url}")
```

2. **Extractor Factory**:
```python
class ExtractorFactory:
    """Factory for creating appropriate extractors based on source configuration"""
    
    _extractors = {}  # Registry of available extractors
    
    @classmethod
    def register(cls, parser_type, extractor_class):
        """Register an extractor class for a parser type"""
        cls._extractors[parser_type] = extractor_class
    
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, source_config):
        """Create an extractor instance based on source configuration"""
        parser_type = source_config.parser_type
        if parser_type not in cls._extractors:
            raise ValueError(f"No extractor registered for parser type: {parser_type}")
        
        extractor_class = cls._extractors[parser_type]
        return extractor_class(
            site_slug=source_config.site_slug,
            source_url=source_config.url,
            tz_name=source_config.tz_name
        )
```

3. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
```python
class EventProcessor:
    """Process extracted events through validation, deduplication, and storage"""
    
    def __init__(self, db_connection, logger=None):
        self.db = db_connection
        self.logger = logger or structlog.get_logger()
    
    async def process_events(self, events, source_id, ingest_run_id):
        """Process a batch of extracted events"""
        valid_events = []
        
        # Validate events
        for event in events:
            try:
                self._validate_event(event)
                valid_events.append(event)
            except ValidationError as e:
                self.logger.warning(
                    "Invalid event data", 
                    error=str(e),
                    event_title=event.title,
                    source_id=source_id
                )
        
        # Store events
        stored_count = await self._store_events(valid_events, source_id, ingest_run_id)
        
        return {
            "total": len(events),
            "valid": len(valid_events),
            "stored": stored_count
        }
    
    def _validate_event(self, event):
        """Validate event data"""
        if not event.title:
            raise ValidationError("Event title is required")
        
        if not event.starts_at_utc:
            raise ValidationError("Event start time is required")
        
        # Additional validation logic...
    
    async def _store_events(self, events, source_id, ingest_run_id):
        """Store valid events in the database with deduplication"""
        # Implementation for storing events with proper transaction handling
        # and deduplication logic
```

4. **Improved API Error Handling**:
```python
@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content={"error": exc.detail}
    )

@app.exception_handler(Exception)
async def general_exception_handler(request, exc):
    # Log the exception
    logger.exception("Unhandled exception", path=request.url.path)
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content={"error": "Internal server error"}
    )
```

5. **Dependency Injection for Database**:
```python
def get_db():
    """Dependency for database connection"""
    try:
        conn = get_db_connection()
        yield conn
    finally:
        conn.close()

@app.get("/api/v1/venues/{venue_id}", response_model=VenueDetailResponse)
def get_venue_detail(venue_id: int, db: Any = Depends(get_db)):
    """Get detailed information about a specific venue."""
    try:
        with db.cursor() as cur:
            # Query logic...
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Database error: {str(e)}")
```

# Scalability Considerations

To ensure MusicLive can scale effectively:

1. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Implement fully asynchronous crawling to handle many sources concurrently
   - Use task queues (like Celery or AWS SQS) for background processing
   - Implement rate limiting per domain to avoid overwhelming sources

2. **Database Optimization**:
   - Add appropriate indexes for common query patterns
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Consider read replicas for scaling read operations
   - Implement efficient pagination for large result sets

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Implement HTTP caching for external requests
   - Add Redis/Memcached for API response caching
   - Cache geocoding results to reduce external API calls

4. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Design the crawler to be stateless for easy horizontal scaling
   - Implement sharding for crawl tasks based on source domains
   - Use containerization (Docker) for consistent deployment

5. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Add metrics collection for crawler performance
   - Set up alerts for crawl failures and data quality issues
   - Implement health checks for all components

6. **Resilience**:
   - Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Add graceful degradation for non-critical features
   - Implement proper retry policies with exponential backoff

7. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Implement crawl scheduling based on source update frequency
   - Use conditional fetching (If-Modified-Since, ETag) where supported
   - Optimize storage of raw HTML (compression, TTL-based expiration)

# Code Review

Based on the provided code snippets:

1. **Extractor Interface**:
   - Strengths: Clean interface with well-defined responsibilities
   - Improvement: Add validation methods and error handling

2. **API Implementation**:
   - Strengths: Comprehensive endpoints with good filtering options
   - Issues:
     - Database connections are created for each request without pooling
     - Error handling is inconsistent
     - No pagination metadata in responses
     - Direct SQL in route handlers creates tight coupling

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Strengths: Well-structured with appropriate relationships
   - Considerations:
     - Add indexes for common query patterns
     - Consider partitioning for time-series event data

4. **Project Configuration**:
   - Issues:
     - Mixing direct dependencies with Poetry
     - Missing development tools for linting and testing
     - Unclear deployment configuration

Specific code improvements:

1. **Database Connection Pooling**:
```python
# Create a connection pool at application startup
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    app.state.db_pool = ConnectionPool(os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"), min_size=5, max_size=20)

@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown():
    app.state.db_pool.close()

def get_db():
    """Get a connection from the pool"""
    conn = app.state.db_pool.getconn()
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        app.state.db_pool.putconn(conn)
```

2. **Repository Pattern Implementation**:
```python
class EventRepository:
    """Repository for event-related database operations"""
    
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.db = db_connection
    
    async def find_by_id(self, event_id):
        """Find an event by ID"""
        with self.db.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("""
                SELECT e.id, e.title, e.artist_name, e.starts_at_utc, e.ends_at_utc,
                       v.name as venue_name, e.venue_id, e.price_min, e.price_max, e.currency,
                       e.ticket_url, e.age_restriction, e.is_cancelled
                FROM event_instance e
                LEFT JOIN venue v ON e.venue_id = v.id
                WHERE e.id = %s
            """, (event_id,))
            
            return cur.fetchone()
    
    # Additional methods for CRUD operations
```
